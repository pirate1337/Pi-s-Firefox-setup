# Pirate's-Firefox-setup

This is my Firefox user.js & userChrome.css.


# USER.JS

The user.js is built with security in mind but with some tweaks to make it suitible for everyday use.

# userChrome.css

My userChrome setup is pretty stock but with a few changes such as removing uncessary things and centering the url bar. It works best with the compact customisation but will also work fine with the other 2.
